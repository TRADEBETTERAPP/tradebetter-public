## How to Write a Good Bug Report

A clear bug report gets resolved faster. Include:

1. **Summary** — One sentence describing what's broken.
2. **Steps to reproduce** — Exact, numbered steps to trigger the bug. Include URLs, button names, and sequences.
3. **Expected behaviour** — What should have happened.
4. **Actual behaviour** — What actually happened. Include error messages verbatim.
5. **Environment** — OS, browser (with version), wallet provider (MetaMask, Phantom, Privy embedded), network (Polygon, Base), and app version if visible.
6. **Evidence** — Screenshots, screen recordings, console logs, or network traces. Redact any sensitive data.

**Example of a good summary:**
> "Deposit modal shows 'undefined' for USDC balance when connected via MetaMask on Base"

**Example of a bad summary:**
> "deposits broken"

## How to Propose a Feature

1. **Problem** — What problem are you trying to solve? Be specific about your workflow.
2. **Proposed solution** — Describe what you'd like to see. Mockups, sketches, or references to other products are welcome.
3. **Alternatives considered** — What else could solve this? Why is your proposal better?
4. **Impact** — Who benefits? How often would this be used?
